            <h2>My 16th birthday</h2>
            <p>It all started on my 16th birthday. Unfortunately, I had school that day. I was so excited to have my friends over, so inherently, the school day was neverending. Especially the last period. My mother picked me up and we went to get some things for the party. Afterward, we went home and me and my friends played Halo while my mom cooked dinner. My father came home around 6 and we had dinner, then cake and ice cream. Afterward I opened presents from everyone. It was awesome!</p>
            <p>After all my friends got picked up, my father asked me if I'd go to the barn with him and help him load up some tools he needed for a job the next day. My family didn't have much money, so I wasn't expecting to get a car or anything, so I had no idea they had got me one, so when we walked through the side door of the barn and saw the car sitting there, I didn't realize it was even mine at first. My father said "happy birthday!" and like, I didn't get it at first. When I finally did, I totally kept my composure and didn't cry or anything.</p>
            <p>Its hard to properly portray this car in words to be honest. The Supra is basically Toyota's way of doing God's work. It had everything! The engine was an inline 6 turbo and it had a 5 speed manual transmission, fully independent suspension, a targa top, and everything else.</p>

            <h2>The aftermath</h2>
            <p>Ever since that day, my passion for cars has grown day by day. That Supra and I have been through a lot together over the years (about 24 now). I have also spent a ton of money on it. Some fixing broken stuff, but mostly modifications. Originally, the car had a 7mgte, which is a 3.0 inline 6 with a small turbo. It was great, but after having the car for about 5 years, the engine started developing problem after problem. For awhile, I kept fixing it, but they just kept getting worse, so eventually it ended up dieing.</p>

            <h2>The Supra's new life</h2>
            <p>After the original engine went bad, I was left in a situation where I was trying to figure out what to do with it. After 5 years together, I was super attached to it, so I decided to try to find a replacement motor. Around this time was when ebay was taking off, so I ended up on there eventually, which led to a whole crazy process that has been developing ever since.</p>
            <p>I was looking at buying a low mileage engine like the one I had in the car originally, but among the engine listings was one for a newer Supra, which had a 2jzgte. This engine is heavy duty and had a twin turbo setup configuration. Once I found out I could swap to that engine relatively easy, I bought one. It was high mileage, so the first thing I did was rebuild it. It was crazy from the beginning, but over the years, I have installed various mods. At this point, there isn't really a whole lot left I can do to it. Nor do I really need to because it is sitting at 846hp. I love it and it was always be with me.</p>
